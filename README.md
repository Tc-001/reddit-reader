Do you enjoy reddit stories but do not wish to support tts content farms? I sure did!

This is only is a proof of contecp/early alpha stage, it has everything from the inconsistent look to barely any features. But I do plan to work on yhis on and off.

If you find a bug ~~it probably is a feature~~ try and fix it if you can. Github has made pull requests suprisingly easy to use. 
Also if you are a UI designer and your eyes don't melt out on the first sight, I could use some help on the CSS too


That's about it for now...
(how can I import the files in again?)
