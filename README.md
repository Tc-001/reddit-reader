Do you enjoy reddit stories but do not wish to support tts content farms? I sure did!     
The site uses `fetch()` and the Web Speech API api so this probably will not work on any nintendo DS's or internet explorer

This is only is a proof of concept/early alpha stage, it has everything from the inconsistent look to barely any features. But I do plan to work on this on and off.

If you find a bug ~~it probably is a feature~~ try and fix it if you can. Github has made pull requests surprisingly easy to use.     
Also, if you are a UI designer and your eyes don't melt out on the first sight, I could use some help on the CSS too


That's about it for now...
